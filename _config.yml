user_description: I am a PhD candidate in Astrodynamics and Space Applications at Purdue University. As part of my dissertation work, I am applying my skills in Planetary Sciences, by modeling the orbital evolution of planetary rings and satellites systems, such as the hypothesized ancient martian ring system, or the contemporary ring system around Chariklo.
